/** 
 * EKBCollectionView extends UICollectionView so that we can pass touch events to the nextResponder,
 * which in our case is the EKBInputView.  This enables EKBInputView to properly display and update the
 * EKBVariantSelector and it's selected variant as the user moves their touch around the screen.
 * We also take this opportunity to disable scrolling when touches are moving around.
